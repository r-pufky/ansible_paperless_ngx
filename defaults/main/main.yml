#  Decision: do not use package - multiple vulnerabilities with PDF corruption
#      for existing files, bookworm package (and backport) affected.
#  Mitigation: use source release. Default gs binary to custom binary

# Max lifetime of Paperless cache files (minutes).
#
# Requires paperless_ngx_config_convert_tmpdir.
#
# Paperless does not clean cache aggressively and TMPFS is typically cleared
# only on boot. Setting this to a lower value will aggressively clear the cache
# and remove files have have not been modified for this period of time,
# preventing 'out of space' errors during mass processing.

# Cache lifetime should be longer than the expected processing time for
# documents.
#
# Default: 30 (minutes).

# Only apply configuration?
#
# Reduces role application time by ONLY applying configuration changes. Does
# NOT affect paperless_ngx_media_set_perms_file_enable.
#
# This should ONLY be used after the role has been fully run once.
#
# Useful when adding a change without reconfiguring the whole system or
# checking and installing a new version. Suggest applying with extra options:
#
#   ansible-playbook site.yml --tags Paperless-NGX -e 'paperless_ngx_service_force_config_only_enable=true'
#
# Default: False.
paperless_ngx_service_force_config_only_enable: false

# Large sets of files may be slow to set permissions.
#
# Useful when first configuring to ensure service has access to all specified
